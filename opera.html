     <h3>The Yeoman of the Guard  Act 2</h3>
     <pre>
        <h5 class="dame name">DAME</h5>
        <p class="song">
        Within its wall of rock
        The flower of the brave
            Have perished with a constancy unshaken.
        From the dungeon to the block,
            From the scaffold to the grave,
            Is a journey many gallant hearts have taken.
        
        And the wicked flames may hiss
            Round the heroes who have fought
            For conscience and for home in all its beauty,
        But the grim old fortalice
            Takes little heed of aught
        That comes not in the measure of its duty. 
        
        The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
        And men may bleed and men may burn,
        O'er London town and its golden hoard
        I keep my silent watch and ward!      
        </p>     
        <h5 class="chorus">CHORUS</h5>
        <p class="song">
        The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
        O'er London town and all its hoard,
        And men may bleed and men may burn,
        O'er London town and all its hoard,
        O'er London town and its golden hoard
        I keep my silent watch and ward!

        [Exeunt all but PHOEBE. Enter SERGEANT MERYLL.
        </p>
        <h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        Father! Has no reprieve arrived for the poor
        gentleman?
        </p>
        <h5 class="meryll name">MERYLL</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        No, my lass; but there's one hope yet. Thy brother
        Leonard, who, as a reward for his valour in saving his
        standard and cutting his way through fifty foes who
        would have hanged him, has been appointed a Yeoman of
        the Guard, will arrive to-day; and as he comes
        straight from Windsor, where the Court is, it may be—
        it may be— that he will bring the expected reprieve
        with him.
        </p>
        <h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        Oh, that he may!
        </p>
        <h5 class="meryll name">MERYLL</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        Amen to that! For the Colonel twice saved my life, and
        I'd give the rest of my life to save his! And wilt
        thou not be glad to welcome thy brave brother, with
        the fame of whose exploits all England is a-ringing?
        </p>
        <h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        Aye, truly, if he brings the reprieve.
        </p>
        <h5 class="meryll name">MERYLL</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        And not otherwise?
        </p>
        <h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
        <p class="speech">
        Well, he's a brave fellow indeed, and I love brave
        men.
